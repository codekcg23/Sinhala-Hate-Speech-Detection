# Sinhala-Hate-Speech-Detection
Final Year Research Project - Improving Sinhala Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning


1. Dataset collection finalize dataset
    1. Evauate with models
    2. Find similarity measure
2. Suitable preprocessing techniques
    Identify suitable preprocessing techniques from litereture review
    1. Stop words
    2. Removing puntuation
    3. Emojis
    4. Stemming
3. Features
    Identify suitable features from litereture review
    1. Traditional features - n-gram, TF-IDF
    2. POS_tags
    3. Negation
    4. word_embedding - word2vec, doc2vec, Glove
    5. Character embedding - Fasttext (UOM,FB) - said to be perform better for low resource lang
    6. contextual embedding - XLM-R, LASER (multilingual)
    7. Combination of features ?
4. Implementing ML classifiers - previously mostly used classifiers in Sinhala researches
    1. SVM
    2. LR
    3. NB
    4. Decision Tree
5. Evaluate  models with different feature sets
6. Interpreat results
7. Literature review - find suitable deep learning techniques
8. Implement DL models
9. Evalaute with different feature sets
10. Interpreat results
11. Perform error analysis on selected models
